# PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

Application of the pickle module to exploit insecure deserialization.

Here i've used python requests module to initiate a connection and send the payload directly to the vulnerable website.As such you need to edit this code and change the requests to the ones of the site you are trying to exploit

The reverse shell used is for netcat however it can be edited to use any other reverse shell generation methods.


Once a shell is gained use the following script to stabilize the dummy shell:
      ```
      import pty
      pty.spawn('/bin/bash')
      ```python
